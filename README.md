# Data Structures And Algorithms

## Introduction

Data Structures and algorithms are the basis of software engineering. 

## Description

We can think of data structures as ways to organize data in order to implement abstractions. 
We can think of algorithms as instructions to give predictable outcomes based on a vigen input.
